# Reinfocement-Learning
Experiment and testing to gain knowledge about Reinforcement Learning.


Reinforcement_Learning_with_Flying_Kite_experiment.ipynb: Custom game "Kite" to test Deep-Q learning with a vanilla neural network. The game is available without the renderer and reward is having the possibility for improvement.
Code, except custom game, is a replica from https://github.com/nicknochnack/OpenAI-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Custom-Environment/blob/main/OpenAI%20Custom%20Environment%20Reinforcement%20Learning.ipynb
